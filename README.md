# bovineprovidence
Bovine Providence is a single player, narrative-driven, non-linear video game. The player takes control of a cow waiting for slaughter. They player can speak to other cows on the farm, who will impart their own wisdom, theology and parables (the text will be readable, but the cowls themselves will simply “moo”); major themes will include the futility of the search for meaning, the inevitability of death, and the function of these modes of escape as a means of intergenerational violence (eg. cows are “forced” to reproduce, which perpetuates the system they are seeking liberation from-- is it best to lie to our children, to supply them with meaning, or to have them confront the truth about the “human” condition). The player can only end the game by forcing themselves to be led to slaughter.
